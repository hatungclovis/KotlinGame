    // Handle word validation and scoring
}
```

### Step 2: Create GameScreen Layout (3-4 hours)

// /presentation/screens/GameScreen.kt
@Composable
fun GameScreen(
    difficulty: DifficultyLevel,
    wordLength: Int,
    viewModel: GameViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    // Header, GameBoard, GameKeyboard layout
    // Integration with ViewModel state
}
```
